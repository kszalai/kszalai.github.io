						This app is a controller for a Lego NXT Mindstorms Robot. Connection is done through Bluetooth. This controller lets you drive your robot with 2 servo motors. My team and I made 2 modes of driving available in the app.
						<ul>
							<li>Directional Touch Driving</li>
							<li>Accelerometer Driving</li>
						</ul>
						The app will also tell you how much battery is left on your robot. There is also a tab in the app where you can see the sensors available on the robot, but that is not functional as it was not required for the class.

					<p>
						Hello! My name is Kyle!<br /><br />
						Currently I'm in southeast Michigan, and during the week I make my way out to Farmington Hills to work at Daifuku Webb Holding Co.<br /><br />
						As a Software Engineer there, I'm currently one of the lead programmers on a new project there. I also took charge of giving their 
						WebbView product a facelift by first making it more mobile friendly, and then by eventually implementing Bootstrap! I've gotten lots
						of fantastic feedback on how the UI looks and currently my version of the UI is in use at Detroit Metro Airport and Baltimore 
						Washington International Airport.<br /><br />
						I recently just graduated with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Eastern Michigan University! I did some minor studies
						in mathematics while there. During my time at EMU, I did some pretty cool stuff! Notably one of my more favored things was my work I
						did with Housing & Residence Life there in my RA position at Brown/Munson Apartments. I was also apart of Kick and Push Longboarding Club,
						made the dean's list 6 times, and graduated magna cum laude with a 3.74 cumulative GPA.<br /><br />
						I have always been very passionate about computers, and having the opportunity be a software engineer now. My position at Daifuku Webb allows
						me to work with developing for the web on mobile, but I aspire to be an Android/iOS Engineer eventually, as it was one of my favorite areas
						of study while at EMU! On top of that, I also got some experience developing video games in Unity, and I also built a web application
						by working with ASP.net, which was an entirely new experience for me at the time! I also got some experience working with databases then
						which continues into my job today! I love working with mobile devices and building applications for them! If you have any questions, 
						please feel free to email me!

					I have lots and lots of experience in programming in Java, which makes it my primary choice of language. It's what EMU uses for their curriculum, and that helped vastly when learning
					how to develop Android applications! On top of that, I also know Swift and can develop for iOS as well. I also have experience with C# as
					I used it when developing video games in Unity, as well	as developing with ASP.net. I also got plenty of experience with C# while at my internship
					at KLA Labs! I also had the opportunity to get some experience with Intel Assembly and C when taking my Operating Systems class, where we
					built a base for our own version of Linux from scratch. I also have experience with Google Apps Script, as I am developed a web app 
					for EMU's Housing & Residence Life department that will assisted in scheduling move outs for the RAs for their residents. I'm also currently teaching
					myself TypeScript and Angular 2 to build much better web apps!
